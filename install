# Raspberry Pi Data Acquisition and Control System (PiDACS)

# Install PiDACS components, including:

# iomgr.py  - input/output manager for Raspberry Pi analog/digital I/O.
# pidacs.py - PiDACS server, including both a local interactive mode and
#             remote access over a network.
# pic.py    - PiDACS interactive client (pic) providing interactive access to
#             pidacs.py services from a remote (or local) Raspberry Pi.
# iomgr     - executable link to iomgr.py.
# pic       - executable link to pic.py.
# pidacs    - executable link to pidacs.py.
# pidacsd   - bash script to start/stop pidacs.py as a daemon.

# PiDACS Python source files are installed in the local destination directory
# (/usr/local/src/pidacs) and executable links are added to the local bin
# directory (/usr/local/bin).  The source files are assumed to be in the
# current working directory.  If the working directory is not the destination
# directory, all files in the working directory are copied to the destination
# directory.  If the working directory is the destination directory, no files
# are copied and the install script simply creates executable links to existing
# files.  This works well with the git-get inatall script.

# The install script has a single argument ($1).  If omitted, the script
# installs all source files and creates executable links, but does not install,
# link, or start the server daemon (pidacsd).  PiDACS components must be
# executed from a terminal command line.

# If the argument is specified, script will install the daemon script, create
# a port_names file from the contents of the argument, link the daemon for
# automatic startup on reboot, and start the daemon in the current boot
# session.  The argument must be a string of three-character I/O port names
# separated by spaces, e.g., 'ga0 gb0, gg0 gg1'.  This string is written to
# /usr/local/etc/pidacs/port_names and is used by the server daemon in lieu of
# the port_names argument normally provided in a pidacs command line.

# The install script is normally executed from the same directory as the PiDACS
# source and script files (/usr/local/src/pidacs).  Usage is as follows:

# ./install                   - Install only files and directories; do not
#                               install the server daemon or execute it.
# ./install 'ga0 gb0 gg0 gg1' - Install files, directories and the server
#                               daemon; link the daemon for automatic startup,
#                               and start the daemon for the specified ports.

# The install script can be run multiple times without an interveneing
# remove.  It simply overwrites previously installed files.
