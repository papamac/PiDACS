# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The remove script removes all PiDACS files from the current working
# directories.  It also stops all PiDACS daemons and removes the daemon files/
# links.
#
# remove is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Usage is as follows:
#
# sudo p2pkg -r PiDACS                  # Remove the PiDACS package files and
#                                         directories from the current working
#                                         directory and /etc/init.d.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# Because it changes files and directories owned by root, p2pkg -r must be
# executed using sudo.
