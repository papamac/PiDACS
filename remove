#     PACKAGE:  papamac's bash scripts and runtime environment (scripts)
#        FILE:  remove
#       TITLE:  Remove the scripts package
#    FUNCTION:  Restore system files to their state before any installations
#               by the install or option scripts.
#       USAGE:  source src/scripts/remove or p2pkg -r scripts (see examples
#               below).
#      AUTHOR:  papamac

#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The remove script removes all scripts files from the HOME and current working
# directories.  It also restores the original afp.conf file (if any) in
# /etc/netatalk.
#
# remove is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Usage examples are as follows:
#
# sudo -E p2pkg -r scripts              # Remove the scripts package from the
#                                         HOME and current working directories
#                                         and restore /etc/netatalk/afp.conf.
# cd /usr/local                         # Remove the scripts package from the
# sudo -E p2pkg -ru /usr/local scripts    HOME and /usr/local directories and
#                                         restore /etc/netatalk/afp.conf.
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# Because it changes files and directories owned by root, p2pkg -r must be
# executed using sudo.  Also, sudo -E must be used to preserve the user's HOME
# directory.  remove checks for this and exits if $HOME is /root.  papamac's
# runtime environment (see bash_aliases) prevents this from hapening by
# aliasing sudo to sudo -E.

# Raspberry Pi Data Acquisition and Control System (PiDACS)

# Remove all PiDACS components and stop the PiDACS server daemon, if running.

# The install script is normally executed from <usr>/src.  Usage examples are
# as follows:

# <usr>/src/remove                  # Remove PiDACS files and directories from
#                                     HOME.
# export USR_DIR=/usr/local         # Remove PiDACS files and directories from
# <usr>/src/remove                    /usr/local.

# remove is also designed to be used with papamac's personal package usility
# (p2pkg).  Usage examples are as follows:

# p2pkg -r PiDACS                   # Remove PiDACS files and directories from
#                                     HOME.
# sudo p2pkg -ru /usr/local PiDACS  # Remove PiDACS files and directories from
#                                     /usr/local.

# Set directory variables.

log=/var/local/log                        # log directory.

# Remove PiDACS files.
