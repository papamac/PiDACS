#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The remove script removes all PiDACS files from the current working
# directories.  It also stops all PiDACS daemons and removes the daemon files/
# links.
#
# remove is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Usage examples are as follows:
#
# sudo -E p2pkg -r PiDACS               # Remove the PiDACS package from the
#                                         HOME and current working directories
#                                         and restore /etc/netatalk/afp.conf.
# cd /usr/local                         # Remove the scripts package from the
# sudo -E p2pkg -ru /usr/local scripts    HOME and /usr/local directories and
#                                         restore /etc/netatalk/afp.conf.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# Because it changes files and directories owned by root, p2pkg -r must be
# executed using sudo.  Also, sudo -E must be used to preserve the user's HOME
# directory.  remove checks for this and exits if $HOME is /root.  papamac's
# runtime environment (see bash_aliases) prevents this from hapening by
# aliasing sudo to sudo -E.
